# Command: /blockchain-research:audit-behavior-gap

Use to formalize an unaddressed behavior-auditing problem.

Steps:
1. Ask which existing standard or pattern is being extended (e.g., ERC-6551, account abstraction, SBTs).
2. Produce a three-part analysis:
   - What the current standard provides.
   - The precise behavior it cannot attest or constrain.
   - Why common workarounds are insufficient (with concrete scenarios).
3. Propose a minimal extension scope and defer non-essential features.
